# Wanderlist
### Not all those who wander are lost.

*MERN full stack web application created in React with a Mongo NoSQL database and Mongoose ODM, using an Express server running in Node. Custom user auth courtesy of [Steve Carpenter](https://github.com/Steven-M-Carpenter/LoginCode) utilizing bCrypt to hash passwords stored in the database. The app gathers and cross-references information from three separate APIs: geoNames for feature data, ezcmd for nearby inhabited place info including postal codes, and Wigle for global crowdsourced locations of all known wifi hotspots. Axios is used for both internal database and external API calls, and custom CSS augments responsive Bootstrap components.*

## WanderList is a world-wide random destination finder.

### It's easy to get information about places you already know... but how do you find hidden gems you've never heard of? 

Choose a type of destination from a list of hundreds of natural and man-made features, and define the scope of your search to be the entire planet, a country, or a region of a country, then hit "SEARCH". WanderList will find all matching features (if any) in your defined search area, and then select one at random as your search result. 

The app will provide linked information to six types of useful information about returned random destination. Three links provide searches for the feature's name, the feature's type, and the country the feature is in. Three additional links provide maps: a map of the feature itself, directions from a nearby inhabited location (if any) to the feature, and a map of all wifi hotspots that have been detected in the area surrounding the location.

The SEARCH function is available to all users. Users can also create an profile and then log in to save any interesting destinations using the SAVE button included on each feature card. Saved features can be deleted using the DELETE button on each card in their personal SAVED list.
